# Escape From Tarkov AHK scripts

A collection of AHK to cheat your way through Escape From Tarkov
## Installation

Download, and compile to .exe with AHK


## Desription

There's a screenshot utility they must have in the game to troubleshoot texture/geometry issues. You just press control + the screenshot button.

This gives you not only a screenshot but a list of everything in currently being rendered on your screen within 8-10 meters give or take. It does this even if there are walls between you and the objects/players.

This ahk script takes on of those screenshots, reads the nfo file, and displays relevant items/players, then deletes both files.

You can use it to:
+Find items in the dark
+See what's in marked rooms before using your key by running up to the window/door.
+Loot buildings with multiple rooms super fast by simply walking in/out of each room and taking a snapshot.
+Sprint while scanning for loot in larger areas like the mall.
+See if there are players/bodies behind doors or through walls.

To set it up, you need to edit the script. Just being 100 percent here, if you need help editing the script to make it work on your system, you probably shouldn't be using it.

Important: AHK is still not being banned in EFT as of the time of this writing. After you edit the script, I suggest compiling it to EXE before you use it in game. Just to be sure.
